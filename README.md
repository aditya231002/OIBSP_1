A SIMPLE CALCULATOR
A calculator created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a simple web application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. The combination of these technologies enables the calculator to have an interactive user interface and perform calculations in real-time.

HTML is used to create the structure of the calculator, defining buttons and input fields for displaying the numbers and results. CSS is applied to style the calculator, giving it a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

The real magic happens with JavaScript, which provides the functionality of the calculator. JavaScript is responsible for handling user input, performing calculations based on the selected operations, and updating the display with the results.

When a user interacts with the calculator, JavaScript listens for button clicks and input events, reads the clicked buttons or input values, and performs the corresponding calculations. The result is then displayed on the calculator's output field.

A typical calculator application can handle basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More advanced calculators might include functionalities for handling percentages, square roots, and more complex calculations.

Overall, a calculator created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a useful and practical example of how these technologies can be combined to create interactive and functional web applications.
